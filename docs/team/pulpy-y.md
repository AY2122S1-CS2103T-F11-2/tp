### Project: RecruitIn

RecruitIn is a desktop app for recruiters in Singapore to keep track of the plethora of clients with different skill sets, availability and experience. It is optimized for quick text-based inputs via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the ease of use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This product will make recruitersâ€™ lives easier through categorisation and filter features to easily access candidates they have in mind.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
