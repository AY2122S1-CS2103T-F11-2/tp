### Project: RecruitIn

RecruitIn is a desktop app for recruiters in Singapore to keep track of the plethora of clients with different skill sets, availability and experience. It is optimized for quick text-based inputs via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the ease of use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This product will make recruitersâ€™ lives easier through categorisation and filter features to easily access candidates they have in mind.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=tohweijie01)

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `mark` and `unmark` users as "Done" and "Not Done" respectively.
  * What it does: Allows the user to keep track of which applicants they have handled thus far.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily note which applicants they have attended to in `mark` and revert their decision in `unmark`.
