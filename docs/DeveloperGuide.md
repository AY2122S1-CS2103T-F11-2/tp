### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Show feature

#### Implementation

The ```show``` command is facilitated by creating an ```ObservableList``` of ```Person``` objects from the
```AddressBook```. A ```List``` of unique ```String``` objects is created, with ```String``` content depending on
the prefix provided by the user. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```show``` command:
![images](images/ShowCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the show operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. A valid command `show n/` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `show n/` into command word `show` and command argument ` n/`.

Step 2. `ShowCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `ShowCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the first prefix in the user input ` n/`. `ShowCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a
`ShowCommand` with the first prefix `Name` as argument.

Step 3. `ShowCommand#execute()` is then called, which will first obtain a `ReadOnlyAddressBook` from `Model`, from which
the `ObservableList<Person>` belonging to the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` is obtained. The names of each applicant within
the `ObservableList<Person>` is then accumulated to form a string of all applicant names.

Step 4. Once the string of all applicant names is formed, `CommandResult` is initialized with this string as argument
and returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the show operation works.
![images](images/ShowCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ShowCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>


### Filter interview feature

The ```filter_interview``` command is facilitated by creating a ```FilterInterviewCommand``` depending on the given
input. This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```filter_interview``` command:
![images](images/FilterInterviewCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Step 1. A valid command `filter_interview past` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `filter_interview past` into command word `filter_interview` and command argument ` past`.

Step 2. `FilterInterviewCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `FilterInterviewCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the user input ` past`. `FilterInterviewCommandParser#parse` then initializes a
`FilterInterviewPastCommand`.

Step 3. `FilterInterviewPastCommand#execute()` is then called, which will in turn call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`
and filters for applicants that have interviews that have already passed. 
 
Step 4. Once the list has been filtered, `CommandResult` is initialized with `String` indicating how many applicants 
have interviews that have passed. This `CommandResult` is then returned. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the show operation behaves at each step.

The following sequence diagram shows how the show operation works.
![images](images/FilterInterviewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterInterviewCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>


### Find feature
The ```find``` command is facilitated by creating a ```FindCommand``` depending on the given
input. This command then updates the ```model``` accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a ```find``` command:

![images](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario illustrated by a sequence diagram for ```find``` command.

Step 1. A valid command `find n/Alex y/0` is given as user input. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse `find n/Alex y/0` into command word `find` and command argument ` n/Alex y/0`.

Step 2. `FindCommandParser` is initialized based on the parse results and `FindCommandParser#parse()` is called
to identify the predicates present in ` n/Alex y/0`. `FindCommandParser#parse()` then initializes a
`FindCommand` with the predicates as argument.

Step 3. `FindCommand#execute()` is then called, which will in turn call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`
and filters for applicants that have `Alex` in their names and `0` year of experience.

Step 4. Once the string of all applicant names is formed, `CommandResult` is initialized with this string as argument
and returned.

![images](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
 **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser`
should not exceed the destroy marker X. This is a known limitation of PlantUML.</div>



### Datetime for interview 
The `Interview` class accepts `yyyy-M-d, H:m` as parsed time format and provides `MMM dd yyyy , HH:mm` as display format.
- `yyyy` : year-of-era in 4 digits, e.g. `2021`
- `M` : month-of-year, e.g. `7`, `07`
- `d` : day-of-month, e.g. `10`
- `H` : hour-of-day (0-23), e.g. `0`
- `m` : minute-of-hour, e.g. `30`

`Interview#isValidInterviewTime` uses `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` to generate a formatter using `Interview#PARSE_FORMAT`,
and checks for `DateTimeParseException` when parsing the input with the formatter via `LocalDate#parse()`. 

The `display()` method uses `java.text.DateFormat` and returns the formatted time which is displayed GUI.

For example, the add command `add n/John ... i/2021-01-01, 10:30` will add a person John with interview time shown as `Jan 01 2021, 10:30`.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
A recruiter that
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has a need to manage a significant number of applications
* works for a company that gets applications for variety of roles
* has a need to filter and categorise applicants by different fields


**Value proposition**:

It can be hard for recruiters to keep track of the plethora of clients with different skill sets, availability
and experience.

This product will make recruitersâ€™ lives easier through categorisation and filter features to easily access candidates
they have in mind. Recruiters can manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
