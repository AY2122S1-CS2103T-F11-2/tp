### Basic Command Format

If you wish to skip directly to specific features, listed below are some **important** text formatting that you should take
note of so that you may understand their descriptions better.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.
* Words that are ***bold & italicized*** refers to a stored applicant detail for a certain prefix.<br>
  e.g. ***Name*** could refer to the value `John` stored as a name in the application.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME` `[t/TAG]` can be used as n/John Doe t/friend or as n/John Doe.
* Items with `...` after them can be repeated multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `delete INDEX...` can be used as `delete 1` (i.e. `INDEX` repeated 0 times), `delete 1 2`, `delete 2 4 3` etc.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. If not, you can install it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).
Download the correct version based on your operating system (e.g. Linux, macOS, Windows) and follow the Java installation instructions.

![Java 11 Download](./images/JavaDownload.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

    **:information_source: Visit the link and scroll down to find Java SE Development Kit 11 as shown above.**

</div>

2. Download the latest `recruitIn.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3b).
Scroll down to the bottom and click on `recruitIn.jar`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should be similar to the below image. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/description.png)
   
   Applicant data are displayed as a list in the **Applicant Panel**.
   ![Applicant Diagram](images/ApplicantDiagram.png)

5. Now that your app is set up and running, lets run through a quick sample workflow on managing an applicant:<br><br>

    <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

    **:information_source: Type in your commands into the Command Box and press Enter to execute it.**<br>
    * e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br><br>
    </div>

   1. Use **`clear`** command to clear the existing sample data.<br><br>
   2. Suppose you have an applicant named `John Doe` that you have scouted from online sources and want to add him to
      your list of applicants. `John Doe` has kindly provided you his phone number, `98765432` and email `JohnDoe@gmail.com`. He has also
      stated that he is applying for the role of a `Teacher` and plans to work `Full time` with an expected salary of `3000`. His highest level of
      education is `Bachelors` and has `4` years of experience as a teacher. <br><br>
      Type in **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/JohnDoe@gmail.com r/Teacher et/Full time s/3000 l/Bachelors y/4` to add `John Doe` to your
      list of applicants.<br><br>
   3. Let's also add in another applicant named `Mary Sue`. Her phone number is `91131513` and her email is `MarySue@gmail.com`. She is applying
      for the role of a `Software Engineer` and is looking for an `Internship` with an expected salary of `3000`. Her highest level of education is `High School`
      and has `0` years of experience as a `Software Engineer`. <br><br>
      Type in **`add`**`n/Mary Sue p/91131513 e/MarySue@gmail.com r/Software Engineer et/Internship s/3000 l/High School y/0`.<br><br>
      Your application should look like this:
      ![After Adding](./images/SampleWorkflow1.png)<br><br>
   4. As an experienced recruiter, you notice that `Mary Sue` may not have the qualifications for the job as a `Software Engineer` and want to add
      a note to remind yourself.<br><br>
      Type in **`edit`**`2 nt/She might not have the qualifications for the job` to add the note to `Mary Sue`.<br><br>
      Your application should look like this:
      ![After Note](./images/SampleWorkflow2.png)<br><br>
   5. Your company then informs you that they would like to interview `John Doe` on December 11th 2021 at 10 am `2021-12-11, 10:00` and you want to remind
      yourself that an interview has been arranged for `John Doe`.<br><br>
      Type in **`edit`**`1 i/2021-12-11, 10:00` to add this interview slot to `John Doe`.<br><br>
      Your application should look like this:
      ![After Interview](./images/SampleWorkflow3.png)<br><br>
   6. Fast forward the time. Your company informs you that `John Doe` has
      passed his interview and is hired.<br><br>
      Type in **`find`**`n/John Doe p/98765432` to find `John Doe`.<br>
      Type in **`mark`**`1` to mark `John Doe` as done.<br><br>
      ![After mark](./images/SampleWorkflow4.png)<br><br>
   7. Type in **`list`** to go back to your list of applicants.<br><br>
      Type in **`delete_marked`** to remove all applicants marked as done, such as `John Doe`.<br><br>
      Now `John Doe` is removed from your list of applicants.<br><br>

6. Aside from the commands shown in the sample workflow above, you may also find these useful:

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
    The commands given below are not related to the above sample workflow and are given strictly as example usages.
    </div>
   
      * **`delete`**`2` : Deletes the second applicant in your currently displayed list.

      * **`show`**`s/` : Displays all unique expected salaries currently in RecruitIn.

      * **`unmark`**`1` : Unmarks the 1st applicant shown in the list of all applicants.

      * **`filter_interview`**`past` : Displays all applicants whose interviews are in the past, relative to current date and time.

      * **`filter_interview`**`future` : Displays all applicants whose interview are in the future, relative to current date and time.

      * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

* Input for each prefix can contain multiple **keywords** separated by whitespace, e.g. `n/John Mary`, `t/friend colleague`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

* You can search for tags using multiple keywords by providing your keywords separated by whitespace in a `t/` prefix. (i.e. `find t/smart kind`)
    * This is different from `add` and `edit` commands which require tag inputs to be provided separately. (i.e. `edit 1 t/smart t/kind`)

</div>

* Inputs for all prefixes are **case-insensitive**.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

* Applicants will not be filtered by prefixes that are not provided.
* Applicants will also not be filtered by prefixes that are provided, yet have empty inputs. (i.e. `find d/` will return all applicants unfiltered by their ***done*** status)

</div>

Examples:
* `find n/John Mary` finds all applicants with either `John` or `Mary` as values for name prefix.
* `find n/John n/Mary` finds all applicants with only `Mary` as values for name prefix.
* `find t/friend colleague` finds all applicants with `friend` or `colleague` as values for tag prefix.
* `find n/John Mary t/friend colleague`
* `find n/Bob p/87654321 e/bob@gmail.com r/Software Engineering et/Full time s/4000 l/High School y/2 nt/has the credentials d/Not Done`

### Filtering interviews : `filter_interview`
Filters applicants by interview dates based on whether they are upcoming or in the past (based on current date and time).
Differs from ```find i/``` as it is not returning all applicants with interviews matching a specific date but 
rather all applicants with interviews that fall into the same group (`past` or `future`).

Format: `filter_interview past` or `filter_interview future`

* `filter_interview past` returns applicants with interviews that were in the past (compared to the current date and time).
* `filter_interview future` returns applicants with interviews that are coming up in the future (compared to the current date and time).
* Either `past` or `future` must be given as an input after `filter_interview`, and is case-insensitive.
* Only one input must be given (`filter_interview past future` will not work).

Examples:
* If the current date and time is 29th October 2021, 1600, then `filter_interview past` or 
 `filter_interview pAsT` will return applicants with interviews that were before and including
  29th October 2021, 1600.

* If the current date and time is 29th October 2021, 1600, then `filter_interview future` or 
 `filter_interview fUTURE` will return applicants with interviews that are after 29th October 2021, 1600.

### Deleting an applicant : `delete`

Deletes applicants by their index from the list in RecruitIn.

* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* `INDEX` uses **1-based indexing**.
* Duplicate `INDEX`s are not allowed. (i.e. `delete 2 2` is not a valid command)
* `INDEX` should not exceed the total number of applicants in the displayed applicants list.

Examples:
* After using the command `list`, `delete 1` deletes the 1st applicant listed in RecruitIn.
* After using the command `find n/John`, `delete 1` deletes the 1st applicant in the results of the `find` command.

### Showing search terms : `show`

Shows unique search terms available for a specific prefix.

Format: `show [n/] [p/] [e/] [r/] [et/] [s/] [l/] [y/] [t/]`

* Finds and displays a list of unique search terms available for a specific prefix.
* **At least 1** prefix must be given.
* Unique search terms will only be found for the **first** prefix input.

Examples:

Suppose the applicant data includes 3 applicants with name and role `John, Software Developer`, `Mary, Cook` and `Mary, Cleaner`.

Examples:
* After using the command `list`, `mark 2` marks the 2nd applicant listed in RecruitIn as "Done".
* After using the command `find n/John`, `mark 1` marks the 1st applicant in the results of the `find` command.
